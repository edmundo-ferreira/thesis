\chapter{Experimental Methods}

In the overall work of this thesis a great amount of effort was put into
experimental methods since they provide the only true mechanism to validate
most of the the assumptions proposed in the previous chapters.
The experimental approach of this thesis can be divided into two major areas,
first the need to measure flow fields inside the flame since they provide
validation to the velocity model proposed in \ref{velo_fields}. The precise
measurement of flow fields, that will server as initial condition for the
numerical model, are obtained via Laser Doppler Velocimetry (\emph{LDV}) which
is described in \ref{ldv}.
The second area of experimental methodology is the tracking of flame front
positions via a high speed camera system. These visualization methods provides
direct validation for the results obtained when solving the G-Equation's, since
there solution provides flame front positions, and velocities.
However before we proceed to an in depth description of the these experimental
methods we provide an overall description of the experimental setup.

\section{Experimental Setup}
The experimental setup consists of cylindrical, propane premixed plenum burner
shown in figure \ref{fig:burner}. The plenum chamber is supplied with propanene and air
from digitally mass flow controller, figure \ref{fig:flowmeter}. These flow controllers get 
supplied from the laboratory propane and air main conducts. The digital flow controllers allow the 
plenum chamber to be supplied with a steady laminar flow in STP conditions and mimizes in realtime 
to pressure fluctuations in the main conducts.
